            <h2>Goals</h2>

            <p>
                At the end of this project you should be able to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Tell a friend about the web. (not the spider kind üï∑)</li>
                <li>List several reasons why someone (or YOU) might make a website.</li>
                <li>Use Code Dragon to make your first website</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Tip: If you get stuck, or don‚Äôt understand something today. Try the following steps.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Reread or rewatch the instructions.</li>
                <li>Try something. It won‚Äôt break. Honest!</li>
                <li>Take a short break. Just moving around and taking a break might make things clearer.</li>
                <li>Ask a Coach for help.</li>   
            </ol>

            <h2>Materials You Will Need:</h2>


            <ol>
                <li>Your computer</li>

            <h2>Let‚Äôs Get Started</h2>


            <h3>
                <strong>What is the Web?</strong>
            </h3>
            <ul>

                <li>We use and share websites on the web, or internet, but what really is it?</li>

                <li>Watch the video below to get an overview of the internet and its power to let anyone share their
                    ideas, creativity, interests, and thoughts with the whole world.</li>
                    <p>

                        <a href="https://youtu.be/Dxcc6ycZ73M">What is the Internet? Code.org</a>
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>So.. the internet or web is an awesome way we can connect with people, information, and
                            ideas from all over the world.

                        <li>You may have only used the web until now, but why just use it? With just a little effort you
                            can start building your own creations to share!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Why would someone, or YOU, make a website?</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>Think for a minute. What are the websites you use every day? What are your favorites?
                    <p>

                        üìù Grab your Coding Journal and list a few.
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>People use websites for all kinds of reasons.
                            <ul>

                                <li>News

                                <li>Weather

                                <li>Entertainment

                                <li>Games

                                    <p>

                                        Up until now, you may have just been a website consumer. Today, that all
                                        changes. In this track, you will learn how to be a <strong>Website

                                    <ul>

                                        <li>Wait! You might be thinking, ‚Äú What if I just like to use the web. I‚Äôm not

                <strong>Using Code Dragon</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>Website Creators build sites using three awesome computer languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    <p>

                        All three work together with each one having its own special job.
                    </p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) helps give the structure for our page.

                        <li> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) gives our pages style.

                        <li>JS (JavaScript) gives our pages life, also known as interactivity. More about this later.
                            <p>

                                We will be learning how to write code in all of these languages as we move through our
                                projects together.
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Web developers also use tools called IDEs.
                                    <p>

                                        ü§ìThat‚Äôs short for integrated developer environments, if you were wondering.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        These tools just make writing our code easier. We will be using a few different
                                        ones in our projects but today we are starting with Code Dragon.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        We are starting with dragons because dragons are just awesome. üêâ Well, yes, but
                                        we are also starting with Code Dragon because it allows us to start building
                                        with drag-and-drop blocks. If you have used Scratch, it should be especially
                                        easy to start.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>

                                        But wait, you might be thinking, ‚Äú<em>Using blocks is for kids, haven‚Äôt I
                                            outgrown this?‚Äù </em>Actually, programming with blocks is a great way to
                                        learn a new computer language.
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>

                                        <li>Writing programs for computers
                                            <p>

                                                Writing a program really involves two things.
                                            </p>
                                            <ol>

                                                <li>First, you need to come up with the specific steps that need to
                                                    happen to create your idea. This is sometimes called an algorithm.

                                                <li>Second, you need to translate your list of steps into something a
                                                    computer can understand.
                                                    <p>

                                                        Now here‚Äôs the catch that makes this whole thing a little
                                                        tricky. Computers are actually pretty stupid. No really, they
                                                        have to see something in a very specific way, or they are
                                                        completely lost. Humans aren‚Äôt like that. Our brains are great
                                                        at trying to figure out what something means even if it looks a
                                                        little (or a lot) different. Don‚Äôt believe me, check out the

                How did you do? Your brain is an amazing code-cracking machine. Computers, however, don‚Äôt work this way.
                They need extremely specific instructions, so specific, coding a computer can be difficult because we
                just aren‚Äôt used to having to think that way.
            </p>
            <p>

                To get an idea of how hard it might be to give specific instructions, check out the video below.

            </p>
            <p>

                Well, a computer isn‚Äôt exactly like this dad. A computer wouldn‚Äôt even try. But this video is a great
                way to see how specific we need to be.
            </p>
            <p>

                Starting with blocks makes this a little easier. Code Dragon will help us more easily translate our
                instructions, what we want to do, into the directions the computer will understand.

                CodeDragon randomly generates your username and you can‚Äôt change it so make sure to write this down in
                the spot in your journal, too. (If the generator gives you a name that is something you aren‚Äôt
                comfortable with, let a Coding Coach know, and they can help you delete your account and try again.)
